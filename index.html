                    <p>I've lead 2 teams and mentored 2 individuals are several different points during my professional career. I never sought it in the past, usually the present lead has to be absent due to some circumstances and I get thrust into the spotlight. I feel I have done a good job, despite rough deadlines and new team members that need to be brought up to speed, I managed to deliver work on time without concessions or crunch time. I have mentored a few times during my career as well, and I have seen those individuals grow and thrive on their own afterwards.</p>
